                I am an open minded learner and enthusiatic to gain knowledge about differnt concepts related to programming.
                I decided to pursue my higher education in Canada because it is a land of various cultures which can teach me a lot many things.
                I will be learning different programming languages along with many soft and hard skills which will make me self reliant in future.
